1) Types of http requests :
get
post
put
delete

If we want to print any response ( we need not to use then() and will be declaring the variable in retun type Response)
Response res = given().when();


2) how many ways can we create request body

	-> using HashMap
	-> using org.json
	-> using POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
	-> using external JSON file
	
	
3) How to pass Path and Query Parameters
	
	https://www.reqres.in/api/users?page=2
	
domain = https://www.reqres.in
path = /api
path = /users
query parameter = page=2  (after ?, it will be query paramter)

We can create multiple path and query parameters


4) How to validate cookies and headers

cookies and headers value be generated in run time
cookie value will not be same in each run, but name will be same
some headers value will be same and some won't
Header is single header (name and value) , Headers(Multiple headers and multiple values)
	
methods =  getCookie() , getCookies() , getHeader() , getHeaders()

list of cookies will be stored in Map (key and value pair)
list of Headers will be stored in Header return type


5) Different ways of Logging (getting logs in console)
	
	log().all() , log().cookies() , log().headers();
	

6) Firstly, we need to start api through command prompt 
	
in cmd, go the directory where json file is placed
run cmd json-server filename


7) Ways to validate response data (json response - Parse JSON response)

Approach 1 : by validating fields in then()
Approach 2 : by creating a variable for response and then converting that response from object to string and performing validation

Note : validate any field from the body, then we will be using the method jsonPath().get()

Approach 3 : by JSONObject class and using loop if multiple fields are there


8) Parse XML Response body

Traverse XML fields from Parent to child and we will be using . in place of / while writing xpath

Approach 1 : by validating fields in then() 
Approach 2 : by creating a variable for response and then converting that response from object to string and performing validation

Note : validate any field from the body, then we will be using the method xmlPath().get()

Approach 3 : Using XmlPath class

Note : we will use getList to get the list of all the specific nodes
	
	
9) File Upload and Download
	
given (multipart and contentType is mandatory)
for multiple files validation, we will use indexing in then()


10)	JSON / XML Schema Validations 

Response validatios -> data
Schema validations -> type of data

Firstly, we will get the response from the request -> then we will get the schema of that response -> then we will validate , whether the resoponse is based on schema or not

Steps to follow:

1) Firstly, we will get the schema of json/xml file with the use of below tools or websites
for JSON, we have a tool in google jsonformatter.org - there , we can select json -> schema
for XML, we have a tool in google or type in google as [ convert xml to xsd ]
2) Then, we will paste that schema in the file (ext = schema.json or schema.xsd) and will place it under src/test/resources 
3) Then , in the code we will use assertThat method for validations and will use JSONSchemaValidator class, from where , use matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath method.

JSON file schema will be saved in .json format
XML file schema will .xsd format 

Postman will only validate JSON schema


11) Serialization and Deseilization

converting POJO -> JSON - serialization
converting JSON -> POJO - deserialization
	
Request from POJO will go in JSON format, request will processed and the response will also be in JSON and then we will getch the response from JSON using POJO
We need Jackson library/api for this conversion.
Reason : as java object is light weighted so its not secure. Thats y we use JSON to transmit the request and get the response


12) Type Of Authorizations

basic - Username adn Password directly hit the server (basic authentication)
digestive - Won't directly hit the server, will do some extra checks
preemptive - Combination of basic and digestive 
bearer token - Need to create a token
api key - we need to create API key for this and then have to use as queryparameters in key and value form
oauth 1.0,2.0 - 1.0 uses specified multiple paramters, whereas 2.0 uses single paramter which is accessToken


13) Faker Library

this is used to generate fake(dummy) data for testing purpose.





















*********************************************
Additional notes : If we have to convert data into string - then toString(), if we want to convert entire response into String - then asString()
